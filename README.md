# Broadcast clock

Digital precision studio/broadcast clock with WiFi configuration, NTP and GPS time sync.

The enclosure is an 25x25 cm [IKEA "Sannahed"](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/sannahed-frame-black-60459118/) photo frame, which is deep enough to contain the circuitry. I replaced the provided plexi glass with a dark acrylic glass plate.

When powered on, the clock will expose an administration wifi network for 30 seconds. Connecting to the network from a smart phone, tablet or PC will bring up the clock's control panel.

The display brightness auto-adjusts to ambient light conditions (can be overridden in the control panel).
